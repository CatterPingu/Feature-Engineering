# Feature-Engineering

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks focused on feature engineering techniques in machine learning. The following notebooks are included:

- Feature Engineering- Handling Categorical Features(2).ipynb: This notebook explores techniques for handling categorical features, including one-hot encoding, frequency encoding, and mean encoding.
- Feature Engineering- Handling Categorical Features.ipynb: This notebook further explores techniques for handling categorical features, including label encoding and target encoding.
- Feature Engineering- Normalization and Standardization.ipynb: This notebook covers normalization and standardization techniques for scaling numerical data.
- Feature Engineering-Techniques To Handle Missing Values.ipynb: This notebook explores techniques for handling missing data, including mean imputation, median imputation, and mode imputation.

Each notebook includes detailed explanations of the techniques covered, along with code examples and sample datasets. These notebooks are intended to serve as a resource to learn more about feature engineering and how to apply it to projects.

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
